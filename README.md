This script can calculate your age if you awnser the questions...

(WARNING: This is a joke, you need to enter your age for it be calculated)

AgeGeussing.py     is the main app
AgeGeusserClassic.py    is the classic app without multiple choice questions
AgePredicter.py   is the old version, but it will show you real age range without having to awnser the age question (this is also a joke ofc)
